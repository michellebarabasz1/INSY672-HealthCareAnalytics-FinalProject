# SEIR Modeling for Disease Spread Analysis
In this project, the differential equations governing the SEIR model were analyzed to determine conditions under which disease transmission occurs. Through this analysis, crucial factors influencing disease spread, including rates of exposure, infection, recovery, and removal were identified. Furthermore, the project delved into the identification and characterization of equilibrium states within the SEIR model. Stability conditions for these equilibrium states were carefully examined to understand the dynamics of disease transmission. Additionally, the project involved adapting and revising code for the SEIR model implementation, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in modeling disease spread scenarios. Parameter tuning competitions were conducted to optimize model performance and enhance predictive capabilities.
